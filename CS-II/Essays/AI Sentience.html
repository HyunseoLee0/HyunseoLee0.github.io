      <h3 class="essay"><strong><u>Introduction</u></strong><br><br>AI, Artificial Intelligence, is the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience. (B.J. Copeland. 2022) Artificial intelligence usually conducts on the following components of intelligence: learning, reasoning, problem solving, perception, and using language. However, what would happen if AI could sense same as human emotions? No one can imagine what will happen.</h3>
      <h3 class="essay"><strong><u>PROS of Sentient AI</u></strong><br><br>If AI could feel emotions, there could be several advantages. Artificial Sentience can help promote interactive commerce. For example, If it identifies a positive sentiment in customer reviews, it will encourage the customer to make a purchase, generating income for company. Simultaneously, if it identifies a negative feeling, it will change the tone and offer alternate products and services based on the customer's desire and perception. Furthermore, with real-time sentiment analysis, we would be able to communicate with a much more effective chatbot. (KSOLVES, 2022)</h3>
      <h3 class="essay"><strong><u>CONS of Sentient AI</u></strong><br><br>On the other hand, if AI could sense emotions, there also could be many disadvantages. Among these, the biggest disadvantages is the problem of unemployment. If AI can feel same as human emotions, AI is not different from humans anymore. In addition, there are many disadvantages: not obeying humans' words due to the increased autonomy of AI, who is held legally responsible for AI errors, etc.</h3>
      <h3 class="essay"><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong><br><br>If AI ever becomes truly sentient, how many people will be replaced by AI? I'm strongly against AI becoming sentient because there are tens of thousands of risks that AI can pose when it acts according to things that humans have not taken into account. Is it right to keep developing AI Sentience in fear of the unknown future?</h3>
