      <h3 class="essay"><strong><u>Introduction</u></strong><br><br>When we do a project or make a decision for something, bias can happen. The bias that we are talking about is defined as a prejudice in favor of or against one thing, person, or group compared with another, usually in a way considered to be unfair. People have different experiences and different thoughts, so in the process of making a decision, even the smallest decision creates a bias. Decision biases are cognitions or mental behaviors that prejudice decision quality in a significant number of decisions for a significant number of people. (Arnott, 1988, Page 3) Therefore, it is important to minimize the influence of bias on our ISP team's decision-making processes.</h3>
      <h3 class="essay"><strong><u>Overconfidence Bias</u></strong><br><br>Overconfidence bias is when we believe too much in our abilities, etc., rather than what we actually have. Overconfidence is the result of overestimating one's own abilities rather than actual ones, resulting in false future predictions. The ability to answer difficult or novel questions is often overestimated. (Arnott, 1988, Page 16) The problem with overconfidence is that we either neglect new information or fail to detect future dangers and fall into false future predictions. For example, they may believe deeply in their knowledge and take on tasks beyond their competence. To overcome this bias, we need to accept the limits of our knowledge, get feedback from the team, and identify areas for improvement.</h3>
      <h3 class="essay"><strong><u>Complexity Bias</u></strong><br><br>Complexity bias is a logical fallacy that leads us to give undue credence to complex concepts. Time pressure, information overload, and other environmental factors can increase the perceived complexity of a task. (Arnott, 1988, Page 7) When we work as a team on an ISP project, getting a lot of information at once, or running out of time to meet deadlines, things get very complicated. When a task becomes complex, it can affect decision quality in a negative way. Among these, extreme time pressure is particularly influential. To overcome this bias, instead of waiting until the last minute, get in the habit of doing your work ahead of time. Then we don't have to be chased by time, and we can think and work at our leisure.</h3>
      <h3 class="essay"><strong><u>Confirmation Bias</u></strong><br><br>Confirmation bias happens when you look for information that supports your existing beliefs and reject data that goes against what you believe. This can lead you to make biased decisions because you don't factor in all of the relevant information. (MindTools | Home n.d.) Confirmation bias causes people to find scientific papers and evidence that supports their theories, rather than making a full examination of the situation. (LUMEN, 2019) To overcome this bias, acknowledge the fact that "I may be biased" and be curious about opposing opinions. Confirmation bias can be minimized by soliciting opinions from others and attempting to accommodate them</h3>
      <h3 class="essay"><strong><u>Hindsight Bias</u></strong><br><br>Hindsight bias is the tendency we have to believe that we'd have accurately predicted a particular event after the outcome of that event is known. (LUMEN, 2019) It is when someone believes that they accurately predicted the outcome of a decision before it was made, even if they didn't. (MindTools | Home n.d.) It prevents serious consideration of what the problem actually is and prevents us from suggesting ways to improve it. These biases cannot be completely prevented, but it is best to always be aware that we can be wrong.</h3>
      <h3 class="essay"><strong><u>Control Bias</u></strong><br><br>The illusion of control bias describes the tendency of human beings to believe that they can control or at least influence outcomes when, in the face, they cnanot. (The Illusion of Control Bias, n.d.) The problem with control bias is that bad decisions can lead to very bad outcomes that lead to a false sense of control over the judgment situation. If only one person in the group can make decisions about a project, the results will be very poor. There are many solutions to overcome this bias from occurring, but the most effective and simplest of them is a voting system. If all decisions were made by voting, control bias would be reduced.</h3>
      <h3 class="essay"><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong><br><br>There would be inevitable deficiencies and inevitable biases because we are human. Rather than dwelling on what has already happened, will happen, or is happening now, it is important to minimize biases and use these findings to achieve the greatest success in our ISP project.</h3>
