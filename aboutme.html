I came to United States of America from Korea with my family on June 30th 2021.<br>My English skill is not good, but I really want to be good at English, so I'm working very hard.<br>Last year was my first year in America, so it was a little hard to adapt to new environment.<br>All of things have changed. My life has changed at all.<br>For now, I think I have adapted this life in America except my English.</h3>
    <h3 class="essay"><strong>What I Love and My Hobbies ...</strong><br><br>I love math because most of problems have only one answer unlike History questions or English questions. I'm not interested in sports, but I love badminton and table tennis. I think I'm good at these. :) Also, I like sleeping at home, playing game, eating something spicy, etc. Of course, I love taking time with my family the most.</h3>
