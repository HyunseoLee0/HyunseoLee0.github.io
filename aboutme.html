    <h4 class="essay"><strong>Hello! I'm Hyunseo Lee! &#128075;</strong><br><br>Nice to meet you! Let me introduce myself to you. I came to United States of America from Korea with my family on June 30th 2021. My English skill is not good, but I really want to be good at English, so I'm working very hard. I love math because most of problems have only one answer unlike History questions or English questions. This year I'm taking U.S. History, AP Biology, English III, Chemistry Advanced, AP Statistics, Computer Science II, and Advanced Pre-Calculus.</h4>
